# Demo FASTA Analysis Project

## Purpose
This demo project was created to practice Linux file handling and basic bioinformatics analysis using Python.

## Tools Used
- Linux Terminal
- Python 3
- BioPython

## Project Structure
- data/: demo FASTA sequences
- scripts/: Python script for analysis
- output/: generated result file

## Analysis Performed
- Calculated sequence length
- Calculated GC content (%)

## How to Run
cd scripts  
python3 fasta_stats.py

## Outcome
The script reads FASTA sequences and generates a report containing sequence length and GC content.

## Note
This project uses small demo sequences for learning purposes.
